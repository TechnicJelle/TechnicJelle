# Hi there! 👋
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TechnicJelle/TechnicJelle/badges/Default(800)0001-0051.gif" width="128" alt="animated version of my logo">

My name is Jelle (/jɛlə/).
I'm studying Creative Media and Game Technologies at Saxion University to become a game developer.

<details markdown="1"><summary style="cursor: pointer; color: #aaaaaa;">My programming journey</summary>

My first start with programming was GameMaker 8.1 Lite when I was eight. I started off only using the visual programming, and I never really got into GML. Sadly, most of the games I made back then have been lost to time.

A year or two later I discovered Minecraft with its redstone, and I was sold. When command blocks were added a little later, I was even more hooked. I spent years playing with it, learning and getting better. I also loved the big tech modpacks, though my computer back then couldn't run it at all.

When I was around eleven, my primary school installed Scratch on their computers. Me being the curious type and seeing that a new icon had appeared on the desktop, I clicked it and almost immediately recognized it as being a similar thing to GameMaker (which I had mostly stopped using by then). I quickly became quite good at it, though sadly most of those projects have also been lost.

For the second half of secondary I had to buy a TI 84 CE-T calculator school and I almost immediately started making useful programs and fun games in TI-Basic. I might put those on here someday too.

Then I discovered The Coding Train on YouTube and I started using Processing. From there I quickly got more into more serious programming and the results of that are visible here on my GitHub.
